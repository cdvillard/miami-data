#Miami Data

## A central hub for all data Miami and South Florida
Miami-Dade County and the cities under its jurisdiction have been growing more and more open to making their data more and more accessible to developers. It still proves to be a bit scattered, and with so many governing bodies and organizations opening up endpoints, it can prove a bit difficult to find open data sets regarding specific topics like as transit, public services, or utilities. This is an effort to provide a more unified place to find such data sets.


#### Status
This is intended to be a living document, updated as new or updated sets become available. The hope is that it will provide a comprehensive list to open data sets from local organizations, municipalities, and governing bodies.

## Why
Information should be accessible, and this aims to make it so for developers interesed in building data visualizations or tools to empower the citizenry of Miami-Dade County.

## Who
My name is Charles Villard. I'm a web developer with a penchant for front-end development, and the curiosity to learn beyond it. I built this for, and with some help from, Ernie Hsung and Code for Miami.
